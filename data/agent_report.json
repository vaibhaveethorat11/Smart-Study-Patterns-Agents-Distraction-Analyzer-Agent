  "analyzer": "Here's an analysis of your study patterns:\n\n### Study Patterns\n\n*   **Peak Focus Windows:**\n    *   **Mid-afternoon (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM):** This period shows the highest focus scores (92-95) when free from external distractions, indicating high potential for deep work.\n    *   **Early Morning (7:00 AM):** A strong start to the day can lead to high focus (81) if well-rested.\n    *   **Evening (8:00 PM):** This can also be a productive period (84 focus) when distraction-free.\n*   **Low Focus Windows:**\n    *   **Early to Late Morning (8:00 AM - 10:00 AM):** This period is consistently impacted by fatigue, resulting in very low focus scores (56-66) and shorter sessions.\n    *   **Variable Mid-Afternoon (3:00 PM - 4:00 PM):** While capable of high focus, this window is also highly susceptible to external communication distractions (messages), which can significantly drop focus (61).\n    *   **Evening (8:00 PM):** Can be a low-focus period if social media distractions are present (70 focus).\n*   **Correlations:**\n    *   **Fatigue is the most detrimental factor**, directly correlating with the lowest focus scores (56, 66) and notably shorter study durations.\n    *   **External communication (Phone Notifications, Messages, Social Media)** are frequent distractors that often reduce focus, although their impact varies; some sessions show moderate focus despite multiple interruptions.\n    *   **Distraction-free sessions** (regardless of time of day) generally achieve higher focus scores.\n    *   **Shorter session durations** (under 60 minutes) are often linked to either high distraction counts or fatigue.\n\n### 3 Root Causes of Distractions\n\n1.  **External Communication & Notifications:** Phone notifications, messages, and social media are prevalent, frequently interrupting sessions and pulling focus.\n2.  **Physiological Factors (Fatigue):** This is a critical internal cause, leading to significantly reduced focus, shorter sessions, and overall poor study quality.\n3.  **Internal Mental Wandering:** \"Internal Thought\" indicates a tendency for the mind to wander, causing distractions even without external stimuli.\n\n### Summary\n\nYour study data reveals a highly variable focus influenced primarily by fatigue and external communication. Mid-afternoon is your peak productivity window when distractions are managed, but fatigue in the morning severely hampers performance. You demonstrate the ability to recover focus from some external interruptions, but a consistent strategy to minimize phone-related distractions and prioritize rest will be key to achieving higher, more sustained focus across all study periods.",
  "distraction": "As the Distraction Detector Agent, I've analyzed your data to identify key patterns and suggest mitigation strategies.\n\n## Distraction Analysis Report\n\n### Top 5 Distraction Triggers with Counts:\nBased on the sum of `distraction_count` for each type:\n\n1.  **Social Media:** 10\n2.  **Internal Thought:** 9\n3.  **Phone Notifications:** 9\n4.  **Fatigue:** 8\n5.  **Messages:** 4\n    *(Noise also registered 4 distractions, tying with Messages for 5th place)*\n\n### Top 3 Peak Hours:\nBased on the sum of `distraction_count` per hour:\n\n1.  **Hour 15 (3 PM):** 7 distractions\n2.  **Hour 16 (4 PM):** 7 distractions\n3.  **Hour 8 (8 AM):** 6 distractions\n\n### Immediate Mitigation Steps:\n\n1.  **Implement Scheduled Digital Disconnection:** Given \"Social Media,\" \"Phone Notifications,\" and \"Messages\" are top triggers, designate specific \"focus blocks\" where all digital notifications are turned off, the phone is placed out of sight/reach, and social media/messaging apps are temporarily blocked on work devices.\n2.  **Proactive Fatigue and Internal Thought Management:** To combat \"Fatigue\" and \"Internal Thought,\" especially during peak hours (8 AM, 3-4 PM), prioritize consistent sleep and incorporate short, deliberate mental breaks. This could include a 5-10 minute walk, deep breathing exercises, or a \"thought dump\" journal entry before starting or returning to a task.\n3.  **Optimize Task Scheduling for Peak Hours:** Schedule less mentally demanding or administrative tasks during the 3-4 PM and 8 AM windows, when distraction levels are highest. Reserve your most critical and focus-intensive work for periods where you typically experience fewer distractions.",
  "coach": "Here's your personalized productivity plan, Coach!\n\n### Actionable Tips for Enhanced Focus:\n\n1.  Implement strict digital disconnection during all designated focus blocks.\n2.  Prioritize consistent sleep to effectively combat morning fatigue and elevate focus.\n3.  Integrate short mental breaks or \"thought dumps\" to manage internal mental wandering.\n4.  Protect your mid-afternoon (3:00-4:00 PM) and early morning (7:00 AM) windows for deep work.\n5.  Schedule lighter, less cognitively demanding tasks during low-focus periods (8:00-10:00 AM).\n6.  Cultivate a quiet, dedicated study environment to minimize external noise and interruptions.\n\n### Schedule Optimizations:\n\n*   Allocate your most critical and focus-intensive tasks to your prime mid-afternoon (3:00-4:00 PM) and early morning (7:00 AM) peak windows.\n*   Re-assign administrative tasks, email checks, or less demanding work to your low-focus and high-distraction periods (8:00 AM - 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM).\n*   Leverage the 8:00 PM evening window for additional productive work only if you can ensure it's completely free from social media and other digital distractions.\n\n### Your 7-Day Study Micro-Plan:\n\n*   **Consistent Morning Kickstart:** Begin each day with a focused, distraction-free session at 7:00 AM, and proactively manage morning fatigue with short breaks and hydration.\n*   **Mid-Afternoon Power Block:** Treat your 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM window as sacred deep-work time, strictly eliminating all communication and social media distractions daily.\n*   **Holistic Wellness Integration:** Prioritize 7-8 hours of consistent sleep nightly, and incorporate short, deliberate mental resets (e.g., breathing, walk) to pre-empt fatigue and internal thoughts throughout the week.",
